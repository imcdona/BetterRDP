# Upinel/BetterRDP Optimization Settings

The `UpinelBetterRDP.reg` is a Windows Registry file that is designed to enhance your Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) session by enabling 60FPS, GPU acceleration, and RemoteFx features. These optimizations aim to provide a smoother and more responsive remote desktop experience. These changes only need to be applied to the RDP server, not the client machine.

## Disclaimer

Modifying the Windows Registry can potentially cause system instability if not done correctly. It is highly recommended that you **backup your system and registry** before applying these changes. Use these registry settings at your own risk.

## Features Included

- Allows both GPU acceleration and RemoteFx during RDP sessions.
- Sets the capture framerate to 60 FPS for a smoother visual experience.
- Reduces compression to improve image quality over RDP.
- Adjusts system responsiveness for an enhanced user interface interaction.
- Disables bandwidth throttling to reduce network-related slowdowns.
- Allows for large MTU packets, which can improve network performance.
- Optimizes the flow control for display and channel bandwidth (RemoteFX devices, including controllers).
- Removes artificial latency delay for more immediate interaction over RDP.
- Option to disable WDDM drivers in favor of XDDM drivers for better performance on Nvidia graphics cards (commented out by default).

## How to Use

To apply these optimizations:

1. Download the `UpinelBetterRDP.reg` file from this repository.
2. Backup your current registry settings.
3. Double-click the `UpinelBetterRDP.reg` file.
4. Confirm that you want to apply the changes by clicking 'Yes' when prompted.
5. Reboot your computer for the changes to take effect.

## Support

- For Windows 8, Windows 10, and Windows Server 2012 or later.
- It is advisable to perform these changes on machines where you have full permissions and control.
- It is always better to test the settings on a non-production machine before applying them to a live environment.
